This turns on graphics, but remember to train your network before you watch it play
, otherwise there isn't much to see.

$ ./dqn-graphics.sh
If you want to revert the changes, run the script with the -r option

$ chmod +x dqn-graphics.sh
$ ./dqn-graphics.sh -r
Note that this reverts the display settings, but does not uninstall qtlua.
Run it with run_cpu or run_gpu (I haven't been able to test run_gpu though). Have fun watching it play.
